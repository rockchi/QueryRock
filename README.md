QueryRock Website
=============================

In hopes of having more hands-on work with D3.js, I decided to start up a personal blog and portfolio to host all the data visualisations to come. To start, I began picking up HTML, CSS, Javascript from FreeCodeCamp. Along side other materials, in particular, DevTips on Youtube, this site you see is the first proto-type of what the site will look like.

A little bit about the project, the site is inspired by Travis Neilson's setup in DevTips built with a setup using Jekyll, GulpJS, AutoPrefixer and BrowserSync. More documentation will come for the site's development. At the moment, building and finishing the site takes priority because I would want to move on to D3 quickly!
